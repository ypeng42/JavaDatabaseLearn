1. not all files are created equal. Some classes contributes more to overall understanding that others.
Ex. some classes have far more comments than other, normally, the more comment it has, the more important it is, learn those files first.


2. Normally context means those are bunch of useful info, but I have no idea how to name them, so I just call them together as 'Context'


3. TODO how about create a intellij plugin to count lines of comment?? normally the importance is proportional to lines of comments
